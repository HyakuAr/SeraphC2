- **Advanced Evasion**: Process hollowing, API unhooking, traffic obfuscation
- **Web Management Interface**: React-based dashboard with real-time monitoring
- **Modular Architecture**: Dynamic task loading and plugin system
- **Multi-Operator Support**: Role-based access control and collaboration features
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Distributed server architecture with load balancing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trails and operational analytics
